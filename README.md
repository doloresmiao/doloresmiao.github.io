# Short Biography

Dolores Miao is a Computer Science PhD student at UC Davis, at the Programming Languages and Software Engineering lab led by [Prof. Cindy Rubio-González](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rubio/). Her research areas are correctness on numerical programs involving floating-point arithmetics, and performance optimization of parallel programs. Prior to that, she was awarded a BEng degree in Communication Science and Engineering at Fudan University in 2007.

She is also a veteran lead software engineer in video game development, with 14 years of project experience, including project and team management. She is proficient in game development in various areas such as graphics/shader programming, network multiplayer protocols, game engine frameworks, performance engineering on run time and I/O, and debugging. She is the lead software engineer of video game **Final Fantasy XII The Zodiac Age**, which was nominated for "Best Remake/Remaster" at IGN's Best of 2017 Awards, and won "Best Remaster" at Game Informer's Best of 2017 Awards and 2017 RPG of the Year Awards.

Dolores Miao grew up in southern China, having lived her first 18 years in Guangdong Province, and her next 18 years in Shanghai. She is a transgender woman and has been in gender transition since 2019.
