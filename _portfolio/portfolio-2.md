Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age is the high-definition remaster of Final Fantasy XII, built on the Japan-only International Zodiac Job System edition and released for modern platforms (PS4 in 2017; later PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch). It refreshes the PS2 classic with upgraded visuals, audio, and a suite of quality-of-life features while preserving—and refining—its distinctive systems.

## What’s Included

Base Game (rebalanced): The full FFXII adventure set in the Ivalice world, following Vaan, Ashe, Balthier, Fran, Basch, and Penelo in a political, airship-filled epic.

International Zodiac Job System content: The revised progression model with 12 distinct “jobs” (classes) for your party, plus various balance tweaks and extras introduced in the international release.

## Enhancements in The Zodiac Age

HD Visual Upgrade: Sharper character models, textures, and UI; improved lighting and post-processing.

Audio Options: A newly recorded, re-orchestrated soundtrack alongside the original; selectable BGM versions. (Dual-audio voice options available on modern releases.)

Speed Mode: Toggle faster gameplay (e.g., 2× / 4×, depending on platform) for travel, grinding, and hunts.

Quality-of-Life: Shorter load times, autosave, convenient map/UI improvements, and numerous balance fixes (e.g., treasure adjustments—no more missable Zodiac Spear due to “trap chests”).

Extra Modes: New Game+ / New Game– style options for challenge runs, plus difficulty/balance refinements from the international version.
