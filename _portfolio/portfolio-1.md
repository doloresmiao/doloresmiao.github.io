Final Fantasy X|X-2 HD Remaster is a compilation and high-definition re-release of two classic role-playing games from Square Enix: Final Fantasy X (originally released in 2001) and its sequel Final Fantasy X-2 (2003). The remaster was first launched for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2013 in Japan (2014 internationally), later coming to PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

What’s Included

Final Fantasy X – The first Final Fantasy entry on PlayStation 2, following the story of Tidus, Yuna, and their companions as they journey across Spira to defeat the monstrous entity known as Sin. It features a turn-based battle system called the Conditional Turn-Based Battle (CTB) and the Sphere Grid character progression system.

Final Fantasy X-2 – A direct sequel set two years later, focusing on Yuna, Rikku, and Paine as they search for answers in a newly liberated Spira. It introduced a faster, job-based Dressphere system for battles and is notable as the first direct sequel in the series’ history.

Bonus Content – The remaster also includes the International editions of both games (previously Japan-only), which feature additional content like optional bosses, new Sphere Grid layouts, and the “Last Mission” epilogue for X-2. A short audio drama bridging the two games is also included.

Enhancements

HD Graphics – Updated character models, environments, and textures.

Remastered Audio – Over 60 tracks of Final Fantasy X’s original soundtrack were rearranged, with the option in some versions to switch between original and remastered music.

Cross-Save (PlayStation versions) – Ability to share progress across PlayStation 3, 4, and Vita.

Quality-of-Life Options (later versions) – On PC and newer console releases, players can use boosters like fast-forwarding battles, auto-max stats, and encounter toggles.

Reception

The remaster has been widely praised for faithfully updating two beloved classics while preserving their gameplay and narrative depth. Final Fantasy X in particular is remembered for its emotional story and voice acting, while X-2 stands out for its experimental tone and battle system.
