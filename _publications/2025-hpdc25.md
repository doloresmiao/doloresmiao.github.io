Porting scientific applications across different GPU architectures
introduces floating-point arithmetic variations that can affect reproducibility, making efficient detection and mitigation of exceptions
like NaNs and infinities crucial. While NVIDIA has dominated the
GPU market, AMD GPUs are increasingly used in HPC systems as
well, yet existing floating-point exception detection frameworks
focus on NVIDIA, leaving a gap for AMD GPUs. We present FloatGuard, the first framework for efficiently detecting floating-point
exceptions in HIP programs running on AMD GPUs. FloatGuard
leverages AMD GPU hardware registers to detect floating-point
exceptions, overcoming the limitations of AMD’s built-in trapping
mechanisms through a novel algorithm that combines assemblyand source-level instrumentation with debugger-guided execution.
We evaluate FloatGuard on 565 HIP programs, detecting floatingpoint exceptions in 507 cases with a slowdown ratio that increases
at most linearly with the number of exceptions discovered. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of compiler optimizations on exceptions trapped, and compare FloatGuard with the state-of-the-art
tool for detecting floating-point exceptions in CUDA programs,
which further reveals key differences between AMD and NVIDIA’s
floating-point exception behaviors.
