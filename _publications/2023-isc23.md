As the demand for developing and porting numerical applications to heterogeneous computing platforms increases, such programs
may exhibit numerical inconsistencies caused by architectural differences
and aggressive compiler optimizations. These numerical inconsistencies
can negatively impact reproducibility and debugging. This paper presents
Ciel, designed to identify the root cause of compiler-induced numerical
inconsistencies in heterogeneous programs. Ciel uses a floating-point
precision enhancement strategy, guided by a recursive bisection search
algorithm with increasing search granularity, to identify the program expressions that induce numerical inconsistencies due to compiler optimizations. Ciel achieves 99.4% precision in isolating numerical inconsistencies
in both CPU and GPU programs, including 330 synthetic GPU programs,
benchmark applications like NAS Parallel Benchmarks and Rodinia, and
real-world scientific applications such as CLOUDSC, a cloud microphysics
parameterization mini-app for the ECMWF IFS. Furthermore, when compared with the state of the art, which only isolates lines of code in CPU
programs, Ciel runs 24.5% fewer searches for statement isolation, and
produces more precise results for 84.9% of the programs. Finally, manual
inspection of hundreds of compiler-induced numerical inconsistencies in
heterogeneous programs reveals common characteristics.
