# Short Biography

Dolores Miao is a doctoral candidate in computer science at the University of California, Davis (Ph.D. expected 2026), advised by Cindy Rubio-González. Her research spans programming languages and compilers, program analysis and testing, and the reliability and performance of scientific software on heterogeneous systems. She has served as a teaching assistant for UC Davis’s Programming Languages course (Spring 2023–2025) and completed graduate internships at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 2022–2024. Her work has been recognized with LLNL’s 2024 Director’s Excellence in Publication Award and the Hans Mauer Award for Best Research Paper at ISC High Performance 2023.

Dolores Miao builds tools that help scientists detect, diagnose, and remediate numerical issues at scale. Recent publications include input-range generation for compiler-induced inconsistencies (ICS 2024), OpenMP performance optimization via mutation testing (PMAM 2024; extended in *Parallel Computing* 2024), and expression isolation for heterogeneous code (ISC 2023). Her paper “FloatGuard: Efficient Whole-Program Detection of Floating-Point Exceptions in AMD GPUs” appears at HPDC 2025. She also maintains open-source research software—FloatGuard, MUPPET, CIGEN, and Ciel—used to study floating-point behavior and performance on modern accelerators. She has delivered tutorials and invited talks on these topics, including an SC 2024 tutorial and a slated SC 2025 tutorial on tools for floating-point diagnosis.

Before graduate school, Dolores Miao spent more than a decade at Virtuos Games, rising to Assistant Technical Director. She led and contributed to ports and performance engineering on major titles such as *Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age*, *Final Fantasy X|X-2 HD Remaster*, the *BioShock* and *XCOM 2* collections, and *Tales from the Borderlands*, focusing on rendering systems, shader pipelines, engine architecture, and CPU/GPU/IO optimization. She earned two Virtuos “Best Employee” awards for her impact.
