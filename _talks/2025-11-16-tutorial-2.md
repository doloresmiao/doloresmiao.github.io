As assistant, I will present FloatGuard, a unique tool that detects exceptions in AMD GPUs. The tutorial is aimed at helping programmers avoid exception bugs; for this, we will demonstrate our tools on simple examples with seeded bugs. Attendees may optionally install and run our tools. The tutorial also allocates question/answer time to address real situations faced by the attendees.
